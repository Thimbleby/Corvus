Graphical Options.length = Logical Options.length = Number of Pattern types used.

*****
Graphical Options
0 - Annulus
1 - Dice
2 - Petals
3 - Spike Rings
4 - Tessellating Squares
5 - Tessellating Triangles
6 - BoxLines

*****

0 - Identity

1 - 123
2 - 112

3 - Addition

4 - AND						Commutative
5 - OR						Commutative
6 - XOR						Commutative
7 - XNOR						Commutative

8 - NOR						Symmetric
9 - NAND						Symmetric
10 - ANDNOT					Non-trivial
11 - NANDNOT					Non-trivial
12 - ORNOT					Non-trivial
13 - NORNOT					Non-trivial
14 - IFY						Non-trivial
15 - IFNY					Non-trivial
16 - IFX						Non-trivial
17 - IFNX					Non-trivial

18 - Magic Squares
19 - Basic Symmetry
20 - Rotational Symmetry
21 - Tessellation
22 - Karnaugh Maps

For logic gates: Commutative >> Symmetric >> Non-trivial

*****
Layout
			
Uses the format [Scale,[Colour, Form, Rotation],[Colour, Form, Rotation]]
The outer annuli uses the first array [Colour, Form, Rotation], and the inner annulus uses the second array
Scale is uniform across annuli

*****
Number of elements in central icon - determines size of Number grid.
Mostly used for logic gate Rules.

*****
Number Answer Layout
For Logic Gates ALL boolean sets (including their answer) must have at least one complete example. 
Make sure the missing element doesn't remove the only answer to one of those sets.
For addition columns and rows must sum |x| < 9 & total sum must be |x| < 9
Combined with shade alterations, negatives can be quite hard.

*****
#Concealed
0 = No missing Icons
1 = Up to 1 missing Icon
2 = Up to 2 missing Icons 
3 = Up to 3 missing Icons
4 = Up to 4 missing Icons â€” N.B. actually having 4 missing icons is rarely possible, due to logic which ensures the items are solvable.
NOT INCLUDING '?'

*****
Type
0 - Missing Icon
1 - Wrong Icon

N.b. Grid size is currently fixed as square.
